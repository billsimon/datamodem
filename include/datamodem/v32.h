/* ITU-T V.32: 9600 and 4800 bit/s, full duplex, on one pair of wires - and
 * V.32 bis, which takes the same modem to 14 400.
 *
 * Both directions occupy the same band - a 2400 baud QAM carrier at 1800 Hz -
 * so each modem has to subtract its own echo from what it hears before it
 * can demodulate the other one. That echo canceller, and the start-up
 * procedure that measures the round trip and trains it, are what separate
 * V.32 from the half-duplex fax modems that share its constellation.
 *
 * spandsp has no V.32, so this is a complete implementation of its own:
 * transmitter, receiver, the 8-state trellis code, the start-up and retrain
 * sequences of section 5, and the echo canceller. It knows nothing about
 * spandsp or pjmedia - samples in, samples out, bits through callbacks - in
 * the same shape as spandsp's data pumps so that modem.c can drive it the
 * same way.
 *
 * Implemented: 9600 bit/s trellis coded (32 points) and nonredundant (16
 * points), 4800 bit/s (4 points), and the full rate negotiation between them;
 * and with v32bis set, V.32 bis's 14 400, 12 000 and 7200 bit/s (128, 64 and
 * 16 points, all trellis coded) and its rate renegotiation, answering the far
 * end's requests and making its own when reception degrades. A V.32 bis
 * modem works to V.32's rules with a far end that is only V.32, as the
 * Recommendation requires. Not implemented: 2400 bit/s, which V.32 leaves for
 * further study, and the Annex A automode fallback to V.22bis. */
