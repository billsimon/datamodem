/* ITU-T V.34 (02/98): duplex at up to 33 600 bit/s.
 *
 * A complete implementation of its own, as v32.c is of V.32, in the same
 * shape - samples in, samples out, bits through callbacks - so that modem.c
 * drives it the same way. What it adds to V.32 is everything that lets V.34
 * get twice the speed out of the same telephone channel:
 *
 *   Phase 1, V.8: the answer tone carries a 15 Hz modulation that says "V.8
 *   spoken here", and the two modems agree on V.34 in a 300 bit/s exchange
 *   (CM, JM, CJ) before anything else happens.
 *
 *   Phase 2, probing and ranging: each modem measures the round trip from
 *   reversals of two tones, sends the other a comb of 21 tones (L1, L2), and
 *   from what arrives works out which symbol rate (2400 to 3429 a second),
 *   carrier and pre-emphasis the line will bear, and how fast.
 *
 *   Phases 3 and 4: equaliser and echo canceller training at that symbol
 *   rate, then the MP exchange that settles the data rate in each direction,
 *   which need not be the same.
 *
 *   Data: shell mapping onto constellations of up to 1664 points, a 4D
 *   trellis code, and - on the far end's request - precoding and a
 *   non-linear encoder, in superframes of 280 ms.
 *
 * Implemented: duplex operation (clause 11) at every symbol rate and data
 * rate, both carriers, all eleven pre-emphasis filters, and in the
 * transmitter all three trellis codes, precoding, non-linear encoding and
 * shaping, whichever the far end's receiver asks for; retrains (11.5), rate
 * renegotiation (11.6) in both directions, and cleardown (11.7). Our own
 * receiver asks for the 16-state code, no precoding and no non-linear
 * encoding, so it can stay a linear equaliser and a 16-state Viterbi
 * decoder. Not implemented: half-duplex operation (clause 12), the
 * auxiliary channel and Annex A's control channel, which are offered to
 * nobody. A far end that turns out not to do V.8 is reported (DM_V34_NO_V8)
 * for the user of this to fall back to V.32 bis, which is not this file's
 * business. */
