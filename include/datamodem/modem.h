/* The softmodem: a data pump wrapped so that audio can be pumped at it from a
 * pjmedia thread while the main loop moves bytes to and from the terminal.
 *
 * spandsp supplies the duplex data modems it implements: V.22bis
 * (2400/1200), V.22 (1200), V.21 and Bell 103 (300), and V.23 (1200/75
 * split). V.32 (9600/4800) is our own - spandsp has none - and lives in
 * v32.c. There is no V.34 or V.90.
 *
 * V.22bis needs the sources in third_party/spandsp-v22bis to be built in;
 * the V.22bis in most packaged libspandsp builds trains and then carries
 * nothing. See that directory's README.
 *
 * V.42 error correction and V.42bis compression are available on top of any
 * of them, via --v42 and --v42bis, and are off by default. When they are off
 * the link is direct async - the same thing you got by dialling a modem with
 * &Q0 set - and a far end offering LAPM falls back to that when we do not
 * answer its ODP pattern.
 *
 * Three things about spandsp's V.42 shape this design. It hardcodes the bit
 * rate its timers are derived from, so they have to be corrected or nothing
 * interoperates; its detection window assumes a copper pair and is too short
 * for an audio path with a jitter buffer at each end; and its XID exchange
 * does not actually negotiate the V.42bis dictionary parameters, so both
 * ends have to be configured to agree on them. */
