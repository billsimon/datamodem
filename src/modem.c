/* Re-offers the line rate we actually ended up at, and retrains.

 * V.22bis negotiates 2400 with the S1 pattern: the calling modem sends it,
 * and the answering modem echoes it back if it agrees. Both decisions are
 * made from what each end heard, within a window that closes for good when
 * training ends. On a phone line that is safe. Over RTP it is not: lose the
 * 100 ms of audio carrying the far end's reply and we conclude 1200 while
 * the far end, having heard our S1 perfectly well, concludes 2400. Each then
 * demodulates the other at the wrong rate. There is no renegotiation in
 * V.22bis to recover with, so the link delivers structured garbage, retrains,
 * and does it again until somebody clears the call.
 *
 * Offering only the rate we settled at removes the question. We no longer
 * send S1, so the answering modem has nothing to agree to and must stay at
 * 1200 - which is exactly the configuration --bit-rate 1200 produces, and
 * which works. It costs one retrain, and only on a call that was failing.
 *
 * Deferred out of the status callback because spandsp raises that from
 * inside v22bis_rx(), on state this would reset underneath it. */

 * DATAMODEM_SELFTEST_LINE describes a worse one, for the things a perfect
 * line cannot exercise: "delay=150,echo=-10,noise=-40,ulaw". delay is one
 * way, in ms, as two jitter buffers and a network would make it; echo puts
 * each modem's own signal back into its receiver that many dB down, a whole
 * round trip later, the way the far end's hybrid does on a call into the
 * telephone network; noise is white noise in dBm0; ulaw passes everything
 * through G.711; burst=20/3 adds 20 ms of loud noise every 3 seconds, which
 * damages a frame or two without making the line look bad on average - how
 * V.42's recovery gets exercised; cut=20/600 silences the line both ways for
 * 600 ms, 20 seconds in, which a modem can only recover from by retraining;
 * drift=100 makes the answerer's clock 100 ppm fast as the caller hears it. A test hook, not an option - it is how V.32's echo
 * canceller and round-trip measurement get tested without a phone line. */
