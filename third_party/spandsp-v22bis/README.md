# spandsp V.22bis, vendored

These are spandsp's two V.22bis source files, compiled directly into
datamodem so that they **override the ones in the installed libspandsp**.
Everything else — the FSK modems, V.42, V.42bis, the DSP helpers these two
files call — still comes from the shared library.

## Why

The V.22bis in the libspandsp that Homebrew installs does not carry data. It
completes the training handshake, reports a connection, and then delivers a
constant `0x55` for the rest of the call, because its receive equaliser
diverges to NaN about a second *before* training claims success. That is
measurable in a few lines of code against the stock library, and it matches
the symptoms users of other spandsp-based softmodems have reported for years
(a fixed repeating byte, forever).

It turns out not to be a defect in V.22bis as written. Homebrew builds the
`spandsp-0.0.6` release tarball from 2012. The sources here come from a later
upstream snapshot — still calling itself 0.0.6, but with files dated into
mid-2014 — and its V.22bis works: both directions, byte for byte, at 1200 and
at 2400, with the rate negotiation reaching 2400. No patching was needed. The
fix was using the newer code.

So most of this directory is not a patch set. It is the smallest possible
slice of a newer spandsp, taken because the version the platform ships
predates the work that made V.22bis usable.

## The one patch: come back at the rate we settled on

`v22bis_rx.c` carries a single local change, marked `datamodem:` in the
source. On carrier loss upstream does:

```c
v22bis_restart(s, s->bit_rate);
```

`s->bit_rate` is the rate we *offered*, not the one the two ends agreed. A
call that offers 2400 and settles at 1200 therefore comes back from every
dropout offering 2400 again, sending the S1 rate-negotiation pattern at a far
end that is sitting in 1200 data mode and has no intention of renegotiating.
The two then disagree about how to demodulate each other, which reads as
noise, which triggers a retrain, which drops the carrier — and round it goes
until one end clears the call.

On a phone line this is invisible, because carrier drops essentially do not
happen. Over RTP a jitter buffer underrun is routine, so the loop runs on
every call that negotiates down. The patch restarts at
`s->negotiated_bit_rate` instead — but only when the receiver had reached
`NORMAL_OPERATION`, so that a dropout *during* training cannot silently
demote a link that never got to try 2400.

This one cannot be fixed by taking a newer spandsp: the line is unchanged
upstream. Note also that a spandsp-to-spandsp test will not show it, because
both ends restart together and renegotiate in step. It only appears against
equipment that holds its rate — which is to say, against real modems.

## What is here

| | |
|---|---|
| `v22bis_tx.c` | verbatim from the later 0.0.6 snapshot |
| `v22bis_rx.c` | the same, plus the one patch above |
| `generated/*_rrc.h` | root-raised-cosine filter tables |
| `floating_fudge.h` | verbatim; needed by the two sources |
| `config.h` | ours — see the comment in it |
| `COPYING.LGPL` | spandsp's licence |

The filter tables are normally generated during spandsp's own build by
`make_modem_filter`. They are checked in here because we do not run that
build. To regenerate them from a spandsp source tree:

```
cc -O2 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I<dir with config.h> -Isrc \
   -o make_modem_filter src/make_modem_filter.c src/filter_tools.c -lm
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis1200 -r    > v22bis_rx_1200_floating_rrc.h
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis2400 -r    > v22bis_rx_2400_floating_rrc.h
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis1200 -i -r > v22bis_rx_1200_fixed_rrc.h
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis2400 -i -r > v22bis_rx_2400_fixed_rrc.h
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis -t        > v22bis_tx_floating_rrc.h
./make_modem_filter -m V.22bis -i -t     > v22bis_tx_fixed_rrc.h
```

## Why overriding the library like this is safe

- Nothing else in libspandsp references `v22bis_*`. Checked across every `.c`
  in the tree: the fax modems use V.17/V.27ter/V.29, and no other module
  touches a `v22bis_state_t`. So no library code can end up holding a
  structure that these files allocated, or the reverse.
- Every spandsp header these two files depend on — `private/v22bis.h`,
  `logging.h`, `power_meter.h`, `complex.h`, `async.h`, `dds.h`,
  `vector_float.h` and the rest — is byte-identical between the installed
  headers and the snapshot these came from. The embedded structures and the
  helper functions they call have the same layout and the same ABI.
- The link order puts these objects in the executable, so they resolve ahead
  of the shared library.

If a future libspandsp fixes V.22bis, this directory still cannot go away
entirely: the restart-rate patch above is not upstream. Rebase it onto the
newer `v22bis_rx.c` and keep `DATAMODEM_VENDOR_V22BIS` on, or drop the whole
directory and accept that calls which negotiate down to 1200 will retrain
until they die.

## The test hook

`dm_v22bis_deaf_to_s1` (set from `DATAMODEM_V22BIS_DEAF_TO_S1`) makes the
calling modem ignore the answerer's S1, the way losing 100 ms of RTP does.
The answerer still hears our S1 and commits to 2400 while we commit to 1200,
which is the one way these two ends can end up demodulating each other at
different rates — and the thing that actually goes wrong on real calls. Two
spandsp ends in a loopback always agree, so without the hook the recovery
path in `check_rate_agreement()` is unreachable from the test suite.

```
DATAMODEM_V22BIS_DEAF_TO_S1=1 datamodem selftest --modulation v22bis --v42 off
```

## Licence

spandsp is LGPL-2.1-only, and these files are compiled into the datamodem
executable rather than dynamically linked. That is fine for in-house use, and
if datamodem is ever distributed as a binary the LGPL's relinking obligation
has to be honoured — which the presence of this directory, unmodified and
with its licence alongside, is most of the way towards satisfying.
